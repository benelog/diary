받아쓰기 해봄.

I can't  freely explain it.
I haven't got words.

It's a feeling that you can't control.


I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are,
And at the same time something makes you whole.

It's like there's a music playing in your ear.
And I'm listening, I'm listening then I disappear

then I feel a change like a fire deep inside
something bursting me wide open impossible to hide.

And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird, like electricity, electricity,
sparks inside of me.

And I'm free, I'm free.

It's a bit like being angry, it's  a bit like being scared,
confused all mixed up, imagine. (  and mad as hell  )

It's like you're been crying, and you're empty, and you're full.
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell.

It's like there's a music playing in your ear.
But music is impossible, impossible to hear.

Then I feel it  move me, like burn in deep inside.
something burst in me wide open possible to hide.

Suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird, like electricity, electricity,
sparks inside of me, and I'm free, I'm free.

electricity,
sparks inside of me, and I'm free, I'm free.
